            <h2>Who Is Dakota?</h2>
            <p>
                Dakota is a 40 lb, four-year old pit bull-boston terrior mix who was rescued from a shelter in Lisbon, OH and moved to Pittsburgh, PA in May of 2020. While he was formerly used as a bait dog at a dog fighting ring, he has been working as an emotional support animal for his owner since his adoption. After briefly living on a farm in Kittanning, PA for the summer of 2020, he moved into the University of Pittsburgh's on-campus housing with his owner and current resides in Litchfeild Towers. Dakota also goes by many nicknames including Koda, Koda Bear, and RA Koda.

                In addition to his full-time job, Dakota has many hobbies that he enjoys in his free time. His most recent passion that he has discovered has been playing with loud squeaky toys during his owner's final exams. He enjoys chewies and treats and toys, although he is hesitant to take them from strangers. He loves going on long walks and wrestling with his best dog friend, Daisy, who is over twice his size. Dakota also enjoys going on car rides and falling asleep. Another one of his favorite pastimes is to take dirty face masks and socks out of the laundry hamper and chew them up. While he usually has a very upbeat and positive attitude, Dakota can also be skittish and scared in new situations. He absolutely despises getting baths and has recently learned that he is barely tall enough to jump out of the bathtub. He also dislikes being brushed. However, Dakota enjoys wearing sweaters or sweatshirts when it is cold outside and enjoys wearing bandanas when it is warm. Overall, Dakota is a very good boy and is very sweet and playful.
