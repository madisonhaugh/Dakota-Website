                <h2>SAD START</h2>
                <p>In mid-January of 2020, Dakota was rescued from a dog-fighting ring in Lisbon, Ohio as part of a police-raid. He was brought into an Eastern Ohio county dog pound along with four other pit bulls that were rescued from the same situation. He was found to be malnurished and covered in poorly healed wounds, but he was also alert and attentive. It was determined by the pound that he had ever truly lived inside of a home before and was kept inside of an old garage. In May of 2020, "Justice", as he was formerly named  due to his background, was finally adopted began his life as Dakota.</p>

                <h2>CURRENTLY CONTENT</h2>
                <p>After Dakota's adoption, he slowly became more accustomed to traditional life. His first hurdle that he learned to overcome was learning how to use stairs, and as he became more comfortable, this eventually lead to him learning other things such as learning how to jump on the couch and learning how to jump out of the bathtub. His biggest challenge by far while acclimating was learning how to socialize with other animals and people. While he struggled at first, he was able to overcome his anxiety surrounding other dogs and meeting new people. Overall, he has made tremendous progress and has made many, many friends along the way - with and without fur.</p>

                <h2>FULFILLING FUTURE</h2>
                <p>In addition to adjusting to home life well, Dakota was also able to successfully step into his role as an Emotional Support Animal. Since receiving his job, Dakota has been able to identify and react to the emotions of others, especially his owner. He has also transitioned from being painfully shy to being a social butterfly. While he is still hesitant about other dogs, he has become more comfortable with people and will walk up to strangers in the hopes of receiving attention. Having a job has been an important part of Dakota's rehibilitaion journey and has helped him step outside of him comfort zone and experience more in life.</p>
